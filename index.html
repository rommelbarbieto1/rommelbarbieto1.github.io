        <h1>About my program:</h1>
        <p>I currently attend as a Business Technology Student at TMU. This program shows a combination of technolgy and business management which are favourite things to do!  </p>\
        <p>One course that I find useful is ITM200 - Fundamental of Prgramming. I think this course is most useful because it helps students build fundamentals of coding and helps us learn to code better at different programming languages. </p>
