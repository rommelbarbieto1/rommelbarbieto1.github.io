    <h1>About me:</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Rommel Barbieto and I am a 3rd year BTM Student! I like to play video games, play basketball and workout at the gym!</p>

    <h1>Education:</h1>
    <p>     - Mary Ward Catholic Secondary School, 2016-2020.</p>
    <p>     - B.Comm Business Technology Management at Toronto Metropolitan University, 2020 - present.</p>

    <h1>About my program:</h1>
    <p>I currently attend as a Business Technology Student at TMU. This program shows a combination of technology and business management, which are my favorite things to do!</p>
    <p>One course that I find useful is ITM200 - Fundamentals of Programming. I think this course is most useful because it helps students build the fundamentals of coding and learn to code better in different programming languages.</p>
